		  Hello! I'm Toopy and he's binoo and today we will discuss about binoo's species of cat. cats are mammals and they come in all sorts of breeds. Like siamese, ginger e.t.c. They love attention and if they vibrate against you it means they like you. They eat tuna and they can climb trees. when they land they always land on their feet.They also love to play with yarn. they are a good choice for pets. they like to be cuddled and they like to be groomed. they also have claws.They like to wander outside. You should always make sure they have a collar so when they are lost and someone finds them they can return them to you. They are also great companions. cats are cool creatures huh binoo? Thanks for joining us. see you soon.
