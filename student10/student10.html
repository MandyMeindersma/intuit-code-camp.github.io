			  This summer I went to slyvan lake and my was it beautiful. 
			  I love the waters it was so relaxing and so nice. We also 
			  had a bbq with some friends that came with us to sylvan 
			  lake. 
			  Close to the end of the day it was time for us to start 
			  heading back home because the next day we had to go to 
			  church
			  early at 9am so yeah. My parents told me so many times to 
			  get out of the water but I just couldn't it was like so 
			  hard for me but I knew that I would have to soon or later 
			  but I wanted it to be later. But that day ended up to be  
			  one of the best days of my whole life and I wish I could 
			  go back to slyvan lake and go back into the water to swim 
			  because I miss it so much. But next year I think I'm going 
			  back there but i want to visit so much other places that 
			  I think i might visit it an other time because i want to 
			  explore new places see new things and learn new stuff 
			  because thats what I'm all about. These are some of the 
			  places that I want to visits like the Sydney Opera House,
			  Hawaii, Miami Beach, England, Spain, Bora Bora and some 
			  other places in the world that I haven't seen yet.
